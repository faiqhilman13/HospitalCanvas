### üìù Expected Generated SOAP Note (Production AI-Enhanced)

#### Subjective
"Uncle Tan is a 75-year-old male with chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes presenting for routine follow-up with chief complaint of ankle swelling getting worse over past 2 weeks. Medication compliance review shows good adherence to Amlodipine and Metformin, but poor compliance with Lisinopril (missing 3-4 doses weekly) due to bothersome dry cough. Patient reports shortness of breath especially when climbing stairs, occasional dizziness when standing up quickly, and ankle swelling with fatigue in afternoons. Maintains low-salt diet with spouse's assistance and exercises 2-3 times weekly with neighborhood walking for 20 minutes. Functional status shows increased fatigue requiring rest when climbing stairs. Patient concerns include worry about kidney disease progression, new ankle swelling, and ACE inhibitor cough affecting sleep."

#### Objective  
"Vital signs: BP 150/90, HR 88, RR 20. Physical examination reveals elevated JVP at 8cm above sternal angle, S3 gallop present with regular rate and rhythm, 2+ bilateral pitting edema extending to mid-calf, fine bilateral lower lobe crackles. Weight increased 2kg from baseline. Pedal pulses present but diminished. Patient appears comfortable at rest but demonstrates mild dyspnea."

#### Assessment
"1. Chronic kidney disease with evidence of fluid retention and volume overload
2. Hypertension - suboptimal control, complicated by medication non-compliance secondary to ACE inhibitor-induced cough  
3. Acute on chronic heart failure with volume overload - new presentation requiring immediate intervention
4. Medication adherence issue - Lisinopril cough affecting 50% compliance rate
5. Diabetes mellitus - stable with current Metformin therapy"

#### Plan
"1. Initiate low-dose furosemide 20mg daily for volume overload management
2. Discontinue Lisinopril and initiate ARB (Losartan 25mg daily) to improve compliance and maintain renal protection
3. Urgent cardiology referral for heart failure evaluation and optimization
4. Laboratory monitoring: repeat BUN/creatinine, electrolytes in 3-5 days post-diuretic initiation  
5. Patient education on daily weights (target <1kg variation), fluid restriction 2L daily
6. Medication counseling on importance of ACE inhibitor alternatives for renal protection
7. Follow-up appointment in 1 week or sooner if worsening dyspnea, increased swelling, or weight gain >2kg
8. Emergency precautions discussed - return immediately for severe shortness of breath or chest pain"
