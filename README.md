# AI-Powered Clinical Canvas

A canvas-based clinical intelligence platform that transforms complex patient documents into interactive, visual dashboards for healthcare professionals.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This hackathon demo showcases how AI can instantly transform a 15-page clinical referral into an interactive canvas with:
- AI-generated patient summaries
- Visual trend charts for vitals and labs
- Natural language Q&A with source citations
- Drag-and-drop canvas interface like Excalidraw/Miro

**Live Demo**: [hospitalcanvas.netlify.app](https://hospitalcanvas.netlify.app)

## 🧑‍⚕️ Quick Demo for Judges

### **Step 1: Access the App**
Visit [hospitalcanvas.netlify.app](https://hospitalcanvas.netlify.app) → Click **"Enter Canvas"**

### **Step 2: Select Demo Patient**
Choose **"Uncle Tan"** (most comprehensive demo case with chronic kidney disease)

### **Step 3: Explore Interactive Canvas**
- **Drag nodes** around to reorganize your clinical view
- **Resize nodes** by dragging corners for better visibility
- **Observe real-time updates** across interconnected modules

### **Step 4: Try AI-Powered Q&A**
Click the **🧠 AIQuestionBox** node and ask:
```
"What is the current kidney function status?"
"What are the main concerns with this patient?"
"What immediate actions are needed?"
```
- Get instant responses with **source citations**
- **Sub-2-second** clinical insights from complex documents

### **Step 5: Generate SOAP Notes**
Click the **📋 SOAP Generator** node → Fill in the **Interview Questions** with sample data → Click the **"Generate AI SOAP Note"** button on the top right of the node to get AI generated detailed SOAP notes

**Sample Data for SOAP Interview:**
```
Chief Complaint: "Feeling more tired lately and swelling in legs"
History of Present Illness: "Patient reports increased fatigue over past 2 months, bilateral lower extremity swelling, decreased appetite"
Physical Exam Findings: "BP 150/95, bilateral pedal edema 2+, crackles at lung bases"
Current Medications: 
  - Lisinopril 10mg once daily (Compliant - taking as prescribed)
  - Metformin 500mg twice daily (Partial compliance - missing 2-3 doses per week)
Assessment/Clinical Impression: "Worsening chronic kidney disease, fluid overload"
```

**Detailed Medication Compliance Example:**
```
Medication 1: Lisinopril
Prescribed Dose: 10mg once daily
Compliance Status: Fully Compliant
Patient Concerns: None reported

Medication 2: Metformin  
Prescribed Dose: 500mg twice daily (morning and evening)
Compliance Status: Partially Compliant
Missed Doses: 2-3 doses per week
Patient Concerns: "Sometimes forget evening dose, causes stomach upset if taken without food"
```
