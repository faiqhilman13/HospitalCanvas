# AI-Powered Clinical Canvas
**Portfolio Project - Healthcare Technology Innovation**

---

## üéØ Project Overview

**AI-Powered Clinical Canvas** is a sophisticated healthcare intelligence platform that transforms complex clinical documents into interactive, visual dashboards. This project demonstrates advanced full-stack development, AI integration, and domain-specific problem-solving in the healthcare sector.

**Problem Solved**: Healthcare professionals waste significant time navigating through lengthy clinical documents. A typical 15-page clinical referral requires manual extraction of key information, leading to inefficiencies and potential oversight of critical details.

**Solution**: An interactive canvas-based interface that automatically processes clinical documents, extracts key insights using AI, and presents them in customizable, role-based visual dashboards.
