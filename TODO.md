## 🎯 PRD-V2 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Missing Features (6-8 hours)
1. **SOAP Note Generator** (3-4 hours) - Critical for clinician workflow
2. **Patient Timeline Module** (2-3 hours) - Essential for temporal context  
3. **Document Upload/OCR** (1-2 hours) - Needed for real clinical data

### Phase 2: Multi-Persona Support (4-6 hours)
1. **Role-Based Views** (2-3 hours) - Different interfaces per user type
2. **Analyst Dashboard** (2-3 hours) - Population insights for Siti persona

### Phase 3: Enhanced Integration (2-3 hours)
1. **Document Highlighting** (1-2 hours) - Visual citation links
2. **Advanced Canvas Features** (1 hour) - Better UX interactions

## 🚀 PRD-V2 Success Metrics

### Must Achieve:
- [ ] SOAP note generation with >85% clinician usability
- [ ] 50% reduction in chart review time simulation  
- [ ] Multi-persona interface support (Clinician/Analyst/Admin)
- [ ] Document upload with OCR processing
- [ ] Patient timeline with temporal event tracking

### Persona-Specific Goals:
- **Dr. Aisha**: Auto-generated SOAP notes, contextual patient summaries
- **Uncle Tan**: (Indirect) Better-informed clinicians via complete data view
- **Siti**: Structured clinical metadata and population trend analysis

**Total PRD-V2 Compliance Target: 12-17 hours**

*Last Updated: August 4, 2025*  
*Status: Transitioning from MVP to PRD-V2 Implementation*

## 🎯 Current Focus: PRD-V2 Compliance

The system has a solid MVP foundation but needs key PRD-V2 features to meet the full product requirements. Priority is on implementing the missing modules that directly serve the three main personas:

### 👩‍⚕️ **Dr. Aisha (Clinician)** - Primary User
**Missing**: SOAP Note Generator (critical workflow tool)
**Needs**: Auto-generated, editable clinical notes from patient data

### 📊 **Siti (Analyst)** - Secondary User  
**Missing**: Analytics dashboard and structured data extraction
**Needs**: Population insights and trend analysis from clinical data

### 🧓 **Uncle Tan (Patient)** - Indirect Beneficiary
**Current**: Well-served through comprehensive clinician data views
**Benefit**: Better-informed clinicians = better care

## 🚀 Next Steps
Starting Phase 1 implementation with SOAP Note Generator as the highest priority missing feature for clinical workflow efficiency.
